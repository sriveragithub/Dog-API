This project utilizes Javascript, HTML and CSS and was built by myself and two other DigitalCrafts cohort mates. JS Functionality includes XML requests, fetch, then, catch, error handling, concatenation and data manipulation. This is my proudest project yet as it combines a lot of different functionalities and looks excellent.
